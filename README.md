This is a repository of selected programs I completed while taking the following programming courses in 2015-2016

To play the games:
1. Open Google Chrome and copy/paste the URL at the top of each file. 
2. This will open a webpage called CodeSkulptor. Press the play button in the top left of the screen.
3. Controls are very simple. Generally up/down/left/right, w/a/s/d, and spacebard are all you need
